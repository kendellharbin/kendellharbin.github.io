Hot Hands is an annual live drawing and fundraising event, featuring works made on the spot local artists, established and emerging alike, each priced at $30. Throughout the night, artists draw, paint, print, tape, and collage on 8.5 x 11‚Äù sheets of paper. When their pencils go down, each work is hung on the gallery wall for immediate sale. Our 2016 event was hosted at the Drug Store Studios, KCMO. All proceeds from the night directly benefit Front/Space and the artists we support.  ---
