    content: THE ROAMING CENTER FOR MAGNETIC ALTERNATIVES (RCMA) is a lending library of over 500 vhs tapes and video technologies traveling Mid-America to connect with outlying LGBTQIA populations. It is an emergent project exploring the correlation between queer culture, video history, and a medium on the edge of obsolescence. By providing a media center for screenings, dialogues, artist-led videography workshops, and equipment access, the immediate aim is to empower communities who wish to uncover and tell their own stories. Taking a wider view, this project examines the role of archives, sharing economies, and self-made media throughout queer history.

    content: For years Kansas City public libraries have purged queer titles from their collections due to low circulation. Similarly, the evolution of video technology risks the edit and deletion of vital voices. I want a picture of Midwest queer communities today. What does it look like to live within the margins of the margins, far removed from the coastal spotlight and unconcerned with the hype of major metropolitan cities? As a queer and gender nonconforming person living in Kansas City, I wish to connect with others who are exploring this vast invisible network.
