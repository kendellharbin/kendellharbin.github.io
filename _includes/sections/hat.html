	      <p>The HAT book was the summative project of my four years as an undergraduate. HAT is a critical inquiry into the practice of collaboration. It developed over the course of a year and took final form as a self published book (many thanks to all its generous benefactors).</p>

	      <p>As shared art-making became a precipitously more popular focus in the art world, I became relatively curious about why that was. Much to my surprise, other artists and scholars were wondering the same thing, however no one was asking the type of questions that preoccupied me. In short, I wanted to know with whom, why, and how people collaborated when engaged with one another creatively. And so HAT came about. 8 projects are featured in total, they range from quilt making, neighborhood event planning, installation arting, amateur programming, and so on. A few specific endeavors, that for one reason or another were given official ‘art’ status, are even featured elsewhere on this website.</p>

	      <p>The project revolves around the idea that understanding comes through practice. Part thesis paper, part artist book, wholly collaborative (from funding to production); HAT is surely not peerless, though it does raise questions you might be hard pressed to find answered in such a format elsewhere.</p>
